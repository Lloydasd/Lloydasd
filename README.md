  <h1>ðŸ‘‹ About Me</h1>

    I am a third-year Psychology student at the University of Ghana and a passionate learner of the ALX Pro Frontend Development program.

  <h2>ðŸ’¡ What Inspires Me</h2>
  <p>
    I was inspired to start coding because I love creating tools that simplify everyday tasks and improve peopleâ€™s lives. 
    With my background in psychology, Iâ€™m fascinated by how technology can influence human behavior, enhance learning, productivity, and well-being. 
    Watching innovators like Gazi motivates me to turn ideas into real, practical solutions, building apps that make education, work, and daily life easier for students and communities.
